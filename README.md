Run the Maincode_live.mlx file to run the case

This is a fully nonlinear and fully custumizable rod model code. It is a simple case of pure bending loading and is set for linear constitutive law. It also has the following capabilities:
1. Nonlinear polynomial constitutive law till power 5 can be included
2. Other nonlinear and/or non-homogeneous constittutive laws can also be included
