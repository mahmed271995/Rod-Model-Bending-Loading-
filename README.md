Run the Maincode_live.mlx file to run the case

It is a simple case of pure bending loading and is set for linear constitutive law
Nonlinear polynomial constitutive law till power 5 can be included
Other nonlinear and/or non-homogeneous constittutive laws can also be included
This is a fully custumizable rod model code
